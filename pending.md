## Pending issues that need addressing 
- very serious validation on foreignkey constraint, based on cascade passed in.
- set default if add foreignkey on a table with values
- validate if fk is null and it is not set as accepting null
- on migration check if any records exist, if any exist ask for a value for those
- run checks when form is being created, please.
