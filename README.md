# powerorm
A simple ORM library with no configurations required for Codeigniter


To use this Orm you need to understand jus two classes.

 - The Base_model class which your models will extend http://eddmash.github.io/powerorm/classes/Base_model.html and 
 - The Queryset class which allows for database interaction http://eddmash.github.io/powerorm/classes/Queryset.html.
 
Both of which i have explained very well in the documentation with examples.
