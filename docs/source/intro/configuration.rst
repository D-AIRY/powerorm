 Powerorm On Codeigniter 3
##################################

Loading
==================

Load the PowerOrm library. preferable on autoload.::


$autoload['libraries'] = array('powerorm/orm',);

on the ``APPPATH/config/autoload.php``.

Configuration
========================
The ORM takes several configurations

- **databaseConfigs**
    This are the database configurations the ORM will use to connect to a database.

    The orm uses `Doctrine Dbal <http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-dbal/en/latest/index.html>`_ to
    connect to database.

    This means the orm will support most if not all the databases suported by Doctrine dbal.

    To learn more about the database drivers supported and the different configurations requried for each databases
    please view
    `Database Configs <http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-dbal/en/latest/reference/configuration.html>`_

    An example of database configuration for mysql is presented below.

- **migrationPath**

    This is location where the ORM will use to store migrations files. in Codeigniter 3, this
    defaults to the ``APPPATH/migrations`` folder.

- **modelsPath**

    This is location where the ORM will exptect to find the model files. in Codeigniter 3, this
    defaults to the ``APPPATH/models`` folder.

- **dbPrefix**

    This is the prefix to use in all tables created by the ORM.
    e.g.

    if ::

        dbPrefix = 'testing'

    all tables created will prefixed with testing so instead of the table *user* it will becomes *testing_user*.

- **charset**

    The charset used when connecting to the database.

- **silencedChecks**

    A list of identifiers of messages generated by the system check framework (e.g. ["models.W001"]) that you wish to
    permanently acknowledge and ignore:

     - Silenced warnings will no longer be output to the console;
     - silenced errors will still be printed, but will not prevent management commands from running.

- **components**

    Use this enable some more features that normally don't come bundled into the orm
    This should be an associative array where the :

        - `keys` the full namespace to locate the component.

        - `value` the full path to locate the component.


Sample Configuration file.
============================

A sample configuration file. ``config/orm.php``

.. code-block:: php

    $config['databaseConfigs']= [
        'dbname' => 'tester',
        'user' => 'root',
        'password' => '',
        'host' => 'localhost',
        'driver' => 'pdo_mysql',
    ];

    $config['migrationPath']= sprintf("%smigrations%s", APPPATH, DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR);;
    $config['modelsPath']= sprintf("%smodels%s", APPPATH, DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR);
    $config['dbPrefix']= 'testing_';
    $config['charset']= config_item('charset');
    $config['components']= [
        'Eddmash\PowerOrmFaker\\'=>APPPATH.'libraries'.DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.'powerormfaker'.DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR
    ];
    $config['silencedChecks']= ['fields.W340', 'fields.E300'];
