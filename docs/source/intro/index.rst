I created this project because i required a lightweight easy to use orm that i could use in my Codeigniter projects
with the least amount of configuration . sort of plug and play if you will. while at the same time reducing repetition
and providing a consistent way to deal with databases.

That is, i wanted to avoid the repetitive actions of creating migration files, creating query method to query the
database and also wanted to be able to see all my database table fields on my models without me going to the database
tables themselves and use this fields to interact with the database.

This ORM is heavily inspired by Django ORM. Because i personally love how there orm works.
